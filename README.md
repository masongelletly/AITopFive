# Review of Pros and Cons of ChatGPT and Software Engineering
Pros: <br>
You can program quicker, and you can write simple code with just a prompt rather than typing everything out <br>
If you do not know what certian code does you can ask Chat GPT to explain it <br>
It can solve simple debugging tasks and can fix easy errors like syntax that you may miss or overthink <br>
<br>
Cons: <br>
If you ask it a vague prompt or not exact it can actually return faulty code that either doesn't compile or work <br>
When you use chat GPT it can be argued that you do not learn as well if you did it with no help <br>
